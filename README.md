# FiveM Credentials Repository

Welcome to the **FiveM Credentials** repository! This project is a curated collection of leaked credentials commonly associated with FiveM servers, specifically those running on `txAdmin` and `cfx.re` platforms. The credentials target servers operating on port `40120` and consist of username/email and password combinations that have been exposed in various leaks or generated for testing purposes.

## Overview
This repository currently contains **4,231 unique credentials** extracted from publicly available sources or generated datasets. These credentials are primarily linked to FiveM, a popular multiplayer modification framework for Grand Theft Auto V, and can potentially be used to access `cfx.re` servers. The goal of this project is to provide a resource for educational research, security testing, and server administration awareness.

### Repository Updates
- **Monthly Updates:** This repository will be updated every month with fresh credentials sourced from new leaks, generated datasets, or community contributions. Stay tuned for the latest dumps to keep your research or testing up-to-date!
- **Focus:** The focus remains on FiveM-related credentials, ensuring relevance to the community and its ecosystem.

## About FiveM and Leaked Credentials
FiveM is a widely used platform that allows players to create and join custom multiplayer servers for GTA V. However, poor security practices—such as weak passwords, reused credentials, or misconfigured servers—have led to numerous leaks of user credentials. These leaks often expose sensitive information tied to `txAdmin` (the administrative panel for FiveM servers) and `cfx.re` (the hosting and authentication service).

### What’s Inside?
- **Leaked Credentials:** The data includes username:password pairs, often tied to emails or simple usernames, that have surfaced from breaches or public pastes.
- **Potential Impact:** These credentials could potentially grant unauthorized access to FiveM servers, including administrative privileges via `txAdmin`. In the wrong hands, this access might allow attackers to:
  - **Disrupt Servers:** Kick or ban players, alter settings, or crash the server entirely.
  - **Steal Resources:** Extract server files, scripts, or proprietary content.
  - **Destroy Communities:** Wipe databases, reset progress, or deface server environments.

## Use Cases
This repository can serve multiple purposes, depending on your perspective:
- **Security Researchers:** Analyze common password patterns and educate server owners on improving security.
- **Server Administrators:** Cross-check your own credentials against this list to ensure your server isn’t vulnerable.
- **Ethical Testers:** Use this data in controlled environments to test server resilience against unauthorized access.
- **Educational Purposes:** Learn about credential leaks, their implications, and how to mitigate risks in gaming ecosystems like FiveM.

**Warning:** While this data can theoretically be used to gain access to vulnerable servers—or even destroy them—such actions are illegal and unethical without explicit permission. Use this responsibly.

## Legal Notice
**All data posted in any `*.log` file within this repository is either generated synthetically or sourced from publicly available datasets.** None of this information is obtained through illegal activities such as hacking, phishing, or unauthorized data breaches. This repository is provided strictly for **educational and research purposes**. The maintainers of this project do not endorse or encourage any malicious use of this data.

- **Target:** The credentials are specifically tailored for `cfx.re` servers running on port `40120`.
- **Disclaimer:** Users are solely responsible for how they utilize this information. Unauthorized access to systems is a violation of applicable laws and terms of service.
